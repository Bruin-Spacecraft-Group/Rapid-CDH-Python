# Conventions and Refactor recommendations are disabled for the CI system, but should be turned on when developing code
# C0301 is line length, as long as you use black to format your code it will be perfect
# W0612 is for unused variables, pyflakes reports if a variable is assigned to and still unused which is more useful
# Note: the following are added to fprime's list of ignored tests for RAPID-0 because of the reasons stated
## E0401 is for imports, which we check using our unit testing workflow in order to correctly handle CircuitPython-specific modules
## R0903 requires at least two public methods per class, which is not a RAPID-0 style requirement
